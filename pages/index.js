                <p> This is a video chat app built with Next.js, Socket.io, and WebRTC. This was a ton of fun to make as I had no experience with Socket.io or WebRTC - luckily there were some great resources from the open source community that I could learn from. It is still very much a work in progress - to get this to work fully I will need to spin up my own TURN server. </p>
